# ðŸ”¢ Missing Element in Arithmetic Progression (AP)

## ðŸ§  Problem Statement

Given a **sorted array** `arr[]` representing an Arithmetic Progression (AP) with **exactly one missing element**, the task is to find the **missing number**.

- If no number is missing (i.e., the array already forms a perfect AP), return the next (n+1)-th element in the sequence.
- The solution assumes **one missing value is always possible to determine** to form a perfect AP.

### âœ… Constraints:
- `2 <= arr.size() <= 10^5`
- `0 <= arr[i] <= 2*10^7`

## ðŸ“¥ Input Examples

```cpp
Input: arr[] = [2, 4, 8, 10, 12, 14]
Output: 6
Explanation: The AP should be [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14]
cpp

Edit
Input: arr[] = [1, 6, 11, 16, 21, 31]
Output: 26
Explanation: The AP should be [1, 6, 11, 16, 21, 26, 31]
cpp
Copy
Edit
Input: arr[] = [4, 7, 10, 13, 16]
Output: 19
Explanation: The AP is already complete. Next element is 19.
ðŸ’¡ Approach
Find the Common Difference:

Check differences between the first few elements.

Use the majority value among initial differences to determine the correct common difference.

Scan the Array:

Compare adjacent elements.

Return the first element where the difference does not match the common difference.

If No Gap Found:

Return the next AP element at the end of the array.
